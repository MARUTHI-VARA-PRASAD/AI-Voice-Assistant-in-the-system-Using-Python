üì¢ AI Voice Assistant in the System (Using Python)

This project is a desktop-based AI Voice Assistant developed using Python. It is designed to listen to your voice commands and perform various tasks on your system, acting like a personal digital assistant. With the help of speech recognition and text-to-speech technologies, the assistant can understand spoken commands, respond verbally, and carry out tasks such as opening applications, searching the web, telling jokes, playing music, and even taking screenshots. It also provides real-time information like the current date and time, performs Wikipedia searches, and can control system functions like shutdown or restart.

The assistant is built using Python libraries including pyttsx3 for text-to-speech conversion, speech_recognition for voice input, wikipedia for fetching information, webbrowser to open websites, pyautogui for screenshots, and pyjokes to add a bit of humor. To run this project, you simply need to clone the repository, create and activate a virtual environment, install the required dependencies from the requirements.txt file, and then run the main script jarvis.py located in the Jarvis folder. Make sure your microphone is working and has access permissions for smooth operation.

Once running, you can interact with the assistant using voice commands such as ‚Äúwhat is the time‚Äù, ‚Äúopen Google‚Äù, ‚Äúopen Notepad‚Äù, ‚Äútell me a joke‚Äù, ‚Äúplay music‚Äù, ‚Äútake screenshot‚Äù, or ‚Äúsearch Wikipedia for Python‚Äù. The assistant will respond to your commands with spoken output and take appropriate actions on your system. You can also personalize it by changing its name using the built-in rename function. This project is fully customizable and can be extended with more features, making it a great starting point for learning about voice interfaces, automation, and AI-based system assistants. It is licensed under the MIT License, so you are free to use and modify it as needed.
